### Interference Channels
A two-user interference channel is a canonical model for multiple one-to-one communications, where two transmitters wish to communicate with their receivers via a shared medium, examples of which include pairs of base stations and handsets near the cell boundary that suffer from interference. Practical codes and the fundamental limit of communications are unknown for interference channels as mathematical analysis becomes intractable. Hence, simple heuristic coding schemes are used in practice to mitigate interference, e.g., time division, treating interference as noise, and successive interference cancellation. These schemes are nearly optimal for extreme cases: when interference is strong or weak. However, there is no optimality guarantee for channels with moderate interference.

#### Problem Setup
The problem setup is illustrated below. We focus on the symmetric two-user real AWGN interference channel, i.e. $$\textbf{Y}_1 = \textbf{C}_1 + h \textbf{C}_2 + \textbf{Z}_1, \textbf{Y}_2 = \textbf{C}_2 + h \textbf{C}_1 + \textbf{Z}_2$$, where $$\textbf{Z}_1, \textbf{Z}_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2I)$$, $$\mathbf{C}_i$$ denotes the $i$-th encoder's transmitted signal, and $$h$$ is the interference coefficient. We assume that each encoder has a length $$K$$ random binary sequence to communicate, i.e., $$\mathbf{b}_i \in [0,1]^K$$ and generates a codeword of length $$n$$, $$\mathbf{C}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$$. The $$i$$-th decoder estimates the desired message $$\mathbf{\hat{b}}_i \in [0,1]^K $$ based on $$\mathbf{Y}_i \in \mathbb{R}^n $$.
